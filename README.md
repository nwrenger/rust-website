# website
This is my own Website coded in Rust with the Rocket framework.
## Whats Next
Developing this website in the Rocket Framework was like a nightmare. Old Syntax from Rust 2015 etc. I will leave it as it is and maybe add or update the handlebars. The Next Website I develop won't be in Rocket.
