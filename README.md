# website
This is my own Website coded in Rust with the Rocket framework.
## Whats Next
Developing this website in the Rocket Framework(0.4) was like a nightmare. Old Syntax from Rust 2015, nightly,...I've upgraded to the new version 0.5 (which is still after 2 Years in RC). I will leave it as it is and maybe add or update the handlebars.
