# website
This is my own Website coded in Rust with the Actix Framework.
## Whats Next
First I developed this website with the Rocket Framewort, and then ported it over to the Actix Framework. I have to say that Actix is faster and it was much easier than Rocket (Rocket was quite weird because of it's old Syntax). Furthermore, Actix is middle in Development and not stopping like Rocket which is after 2 Years still in RC State. I will continue to develop this webside with Actix. I have thought about a small Browser Game or something else in the future...
